      <h3>The Australian War Memorial</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="intro-main">
    <p>The roll of honour is a key feature of the Australian War memorial, as it commemorates the members of the Australian armed forces that have died as a result of there service (Memorial, 2018).The recorded entries of the roll of honour document the personal information, unit, date and death of each person on the wall (Memorial, 2018). Additionally to the roll of honour the Memorial also provides additional information through the Roll of honour data base which allows users to search family surnames and refine their search (Memorial, 2018).  This document proposes a review into the creation of a mobile web based application that will allow users to navigate the honour roll environment and gain further insight into the names listed on the roll, respecting the core values of the the environment.

    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <h3>Problem and User Group</h3>
    </div>
<div class="problem-main">
<p>On the 1st of March I researched the Australian War memorial for possible web based solutions and took a particular interest in the roll of honour and its surrounding environment. The roll of honour is a environment in the War memorial, that is treated with respect, solidarity and reflection and because of this the environment is free of signage, way finding, prompts and additional information. My original concepts were primarily based around way finding and allowing the user to virtually navigate the pre exisiting environment, to preserve the core values of the space. However with the lack of visual signage and information the space lacks information for the visitor.
According to Wineman, a museum or exhibit without the use of visual signage or information lacks user interaction and engagement (Wineman, 2010). Based on this knowledge it was evident that a solution was needed to address the wayfinding needs of the visitors as well as their engagement with the environment.The target audience for the design solution will be centred around the visitors the war memorial, which includes a number of user groups from school groups, international visitors and adult patrons (The Australian War Memorial, 2018).</p>

   <ul>

        <h3>Google arts and culture application</h3>
        <p>
          The first solution that I researched was the Google Arts and Culture application, designed specifically around arts and culture. The application allows users to explore top exhibits around the world, as well as a detailed look at artwork scans, photos, videos and manuscripts (Google, 2018). The overall emphasis of the application is to allow the user to become their own curator of content and art works (Google, 2018). An additional feature of the app is a selfie/portrait matcher, which allows users to take and image of themselves and then match the image to a dataset of portraits (Google, 2018). 

          The major design conventions of this application are its use of the users mobile device camera, the ui of the camera and the presentation of data once the user has had their image matched to the database. Used in this application is facial recognition code supported by google, additionally to facial recognition supported features, Google also offers the use of text recognition software which like the facial recognition software, allows the user to take an image of text and match it against a database and present a result (Google, 2018). The Google arts and culture application is particularly relevant to the Australian war memorial, as it refines a large collection that allows it to be accessible to users and like the current situation of the memorial needs, a solution to provide information and allow visitors to navigate the collection.

       <li>
        <h3>Immigration museum multilingual tours application</h3>
        <p>
          The second solution I researched was the Immigration museum Victoria, multilingual tours application. This application allows visitors to the museum from various multicultural backgrounds  to scan codes on the exhibit signs to firstly, read out the text in their desired language and additionally gave a display of extra content that the user might like viewing within the museum (Museums Victoria, 2018). Unlike the google arts and culture application, this application utilises the google text-recognition plugin which allows the user to scan text based content and to have the text be read back to them (Museums Victoria, 2018).


          The major design conventions of this application are its use of the google text recognition plugin, its ui design conventions and the use of code and plugins that cater for an international audience. In the context of the Australian war memorial, this application is particularly relevant, as it works within an environment similar to the memorial, it allows the user to gain further insight into the exhibits, without the need of signage or information and provides a service that communicates information to international visitors.
        </p>
      </li>


      <li>
        <h3>Field Guide App for Victorian fauna</h3>
        <p>
          The third solution I researched was the Field guide app for Victoria fauna, which is used in conjunction with the royal botanical gardens of Victoria (Museums Victoria, 2018). It features a camera application that allows visitors to the garden to scan codes on signage around to the garden to be presented with data about the specific bird species in the designated area (Museums Victoria, 2018). Additionally to this feature it also allows users to take images of birds they see and apply them to a database of images in an attempt to tell the user what species the bird is (Museums Victoria, 2018).

          The major design conventions that this application presents is conventions around presenting data to the user after a code is scanned. This application isnt applicable to the War memorial in the sense of scanning signage, however the concept of allowing users to scan or photograph a piece of the collection to provide additional information, would suit the environment of the honour roll.

         <div id="school-con">
            <p>According to the War memorial statistics on visitor numbers, school groups form approximately 40% of annual visitors. Ranging from the ages of 10 - 16 they form a main percentage of visitor numbers and they should be a specific user group focus of the web design solution. When designing for this age category users are appeal to web based applications that promote user engagement (Saffer, 2010). It is evident that the web based solution for this problem needs to address this user group.</p>
         </div>
         <div id="int-content">
          <p>
            According to the War memorials statistics, international visitors form 15% of annual visitor numbers (Memorial, 2018). When designing a web based solution for an international market, symbols and symbolism should be user frequently to communicate ideas and solutions (Russo,1993). As the attendance rate of international visitors isnt as high as school groups, there do need to be some elements that cater for this target audience.

<div id="proposal-content">
    <p>Based on my research on the target audience and previous examples of museum and institution web solutions. I propose to make a mobile based web solution that allows the visitor to the roll of honour, to engage further with the exhibition as well as basic navigation to allow the visitor to navigate the roll of honour. The mobile web application will feature an investigate the honour roll feature, that will allow the visitor to use a camera on their device to scan a name on the honour roll and be provided with more information on that person, which will most likely be provided through the Australian war memorial archives. This feature will allow the visitor to engage with the honour roll in a respectful and reflecting behaviour that will add to the overall engagement and interactivity of the environment, supporting evidence found in my research of target audience. It also adds another dimension to the exhibit itself, by expanding on just a name and providing them with images and information about the individual, forming an emotionally stimulating experience. The scanning of the names through the honour roll would be best supported by Google text Api sourced at (https://developers.google.com/vision/text-overview), which was used in 2 of my researched web applications. The overall ui and display of end content was heavily influenced by my researched web applications.

      <p>The second part of the mobile web solution addresses, the lack of way-finding/ signage direction at the roll of honour. The where am I? Feature will allow visitors to see their current location based on the location of their device, it will provide realtime mapping feedback to the user. Additionally the map will be detailed, allowing the visitor to find specific surname areas. As found in my researched applications, Google maps api was used frequently and has a number of cultural institutions mapped and this solution would be best suited to this application of the Api.
